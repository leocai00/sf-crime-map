    <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
    <div class="overview">
        <h2>Topic Description</h2>
        <p>
            I am interested in the topic of Safety, especially student safety. Now a day, crime and violence have
            become a huge problem.
            A lot of incidents happened around the campus. <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/data/crime-rates-down-in-most-seattle-neighborhoods-but-theres-a-big-divide-between-north-and-south/">
                The crime rate has increased by more than 20% since the past few years in the University District.</a>
            Last year, someone broke
            my car window and thieved my camera from my car. From then on, I never left any valuable things in a
            vehicle. I have also heard a lot
            of criminal incidents from my friends and received many UW Alter notifications. How shall we prevent crime
            around campus and how
            to ensure the safety of students are always the questions in my mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            The school provides a lot of services like <a href="https://facilities.uw.edu/catalog/nr">night ride</a>
            and
            <a href="http://police.uw.edu/services/safetyescortservices/">night walk</a> to ensure studentsâ€™ safety and
            prevent crime, but still, there
            are plenty of students who do not use any of those services because it may take too long to wait for night
            ride or they are just
            lazy to request a night walk. For those students who walk along during the midnight, they may be explored
            to some potential risks.
            How can we help those students to arrive home safely? That is the problem we need to solve now.
            Furthermore, the problem is not only
            for students but also for everyone. For example, A tourist who visited Los Angeles was attacked and got
            injured because he was not
            familiar with the city and accidental walk into a high crime area. I would like to raise a question of how
            to help a tourist to plan
            his/her routes in an unfamiliar city and avoid involving into criminal incidents? Let me introduce a few
            potential solutions for that
            issue in the following section.

        <h2>Potential Web Applications </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Safe Route Planer</li>
            <li>Real Time Location Share and Emergency Alter</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Safe Route Planer:</strong> The purpose of this app is to help people plan a safe walking route. The app will
            evaluate the safety of all the possible routes and recommend the safest one for the selected range of time.
            Most walking routes planning apps like <a href="https://www.google.com/maps">Google Map</a> only evaluate
            time and distance.
            The app can fill in the blank area and prevent people from crime.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Real Time Location Share and Emergency Alter:</strong> The purpose of this app is to help people share their
            location,
            when
            dangerous things happen. Users can notify the local police with their location and emergency, so they can
            get help immediately.
